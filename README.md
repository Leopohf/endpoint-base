# Odds project
This is a first attempt to build a node/express project in order to build statistics for personal educative pourposes

## Why this project?
the main aim of this project is to be educative and a way to keep myself focused on study on concepts and the specifications of TS:

- OOP
- functional programing
- Webpack
- REST services
- microservices
- HTTP

Some of these concepts may not be related, while others may complement each other well, and some may even seem opposite to each other. However, the purpose of this project is to help me internalize the concepts I am reading and practice them, even though I may already have some prior knowledge about them.

## ~~Github Copilot (deprecated)~~
~~During the development of this personal project I would like to use Github Copilot in order to speed a bit the development since I am not new to code and also will help me to focus on deliver to myself~~

## AWS codewhisperer
To continue with the development asisted by an AI with low cost I will continue using AWS codewhisperer as it is free for single use as I am doing now, on single test does the same job with the same issues

## Security
I understand that copilot is a tool that may deliver unsecure code more often but this is not a project to check that so this is a low priority element and I will not focus on this for some time. This does not mean this could not change in the future.
