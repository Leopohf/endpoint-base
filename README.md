# Odds project
This is a first attempt to build a node/express project in order to build statistics for personal educative pourposes

## Why this project?
the main aim of this project is to be educative and a way to keep myself focused on study on concepts and the specifications of JS and TS:

- OOP
- functional programing
- Webpack
- REST services
- microservices
- HTTP

Some of these concepts may not be related, while others may complement each other well, and some may even seem opposite to each other. However, the purpose of this project is to help me internalize the concepts I am reading and practice them, even though I may already have some prior knowledge about them.
